# StackOverFlow Survey Data Analysis

This repository is associated with my [medium.com](https://medium.com/@renju.s.mathew/938aa4ac46b3) article on the subject. 
All the relevant content is in the jupyter notebook: `Analysis-of-StackOverFlow-SurveyData-2017to2021.ipynb`. This notebook contains data analysis of [StackOverFlow survey data](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) for the years 2017 â€“ 2021. Figures generated in the notebook are saved as `Languages.png`, `Gender.png`, `Race-Ethnicity2.png`, and `Top10Table.png`. These are Figures 1, 2, 3, and Table 1 respectively in the medium.com article.

This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining) Process. 

1. Business Understanding: We are analysing yearly StackOverFlow survey data to identify trends of interest to developers.
2. Data Understanding: Trends in the survey data related to Gender, Race, and Popular Programming Languages are analysed. The labelling of these varies from year to year so these categorical variables need to be handled carefully.
3. Data Preparation: Data preparation steps are outlined in the notebook.
4. Modelling: No machine learning was performed. Visualisations for the interesting trends were saved as .png files.
5. Evaluation & Deployment: This is done in the [medium.com](https://medium.com/@renju.s.mathew/938aa4ac46b3) article.

Summary of the results of the analysis:
1. In 2017, Java was the most popular programming language and C was in second place; in 2021, C and Java have swapped positions.
2. The gender representation has remained almost the same over the five years, with a 91% male representation.
3. The race/ethnicity representation has changed over the five years, with "White or of European descent" decreasing from 71% to 53%.
