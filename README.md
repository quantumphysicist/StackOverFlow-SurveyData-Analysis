# StackOverFlow Survey Data Analysis

All the relevant content is in the jupyter notebook: `Analysis-of-StackOverFlow-SurveyData-2017to2021.ipynb` This notebook contains data analysis of StackOverFlow survey data for the years [2017 â€“ 2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Figures generated in the notebook are saved as `Gender.png`, `Race-Ethnicity2.png`, and `Languages.png`. 

This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining) Process. 

1. Business Understanding: We are analysing yearly data to identify trends of interest to developers.
2. Data Understanding: Trends in the survey data related to  Gender, Race and Popular Programming Languages are analysed. The labelling of these varies from year to year so wrangling was necessary.
3. Data Preparation: Data preparation steps are outlined in the notebook.
4. Modeling: No machine learning was performed. Descriptive statistics were visualised.
5. Evaluation & Deployment: This is done in the [medium.com](https://medium.com/@renju.s.mathew/938aa4ac46b3) article.
